                <p> <span class="quote-box">"I have been given great feedback and encouragement by the TSS coaches. 
                    This last winter I took part in the Winter Cycling class and it made a huge difference to my spring rides. 
                    The coaches are caring professionals and they know their business."</span>  
                    Our mission at TSS is to help you reach your athletic goals through motivation, support, and education. We have years of experience with athletes of all ages and abilities and we're happy to assist any athlete committed to pursuing his or her dreams. 
                    <br><br>We offer one-on-one coaching, evaluation, and instruction; but we also offer small group practices. Our classes are never large in number. We believe that a low coach-to-athlete ratio provides the best results in the shortest time.
                    <br><br>Come in and introduce yourself to our team of coaches and educators.

                <br><br>
                Since being talked into his first triathlon at 16, Kevin has always enjoyed the challenge the sport provides. His motivation comes from the desire to improve himself, not the desire to beat others. Starting as a middle of the pack athlete, his initial goal was to work his way through the distances which culminated with an Ironman finish in 2010.

            <p>
                Fitness has always been a part of Tammy's life. Whether it was running, cycling, or strength conditioning she has dedicated herself to fitness and a healthy lifestyle. Trained as a mechanical designer, Tammy has designed commercial strength products used in health clubs around the country. Her interests led her to TSS, first as one of our athletes and then, 4 years ago, as a member of the staff.
                <br><br>
                After completing her USAT certification training, Tammy designed the course of workouts we use with our runners and cyclists. Tammy is also our nutritionist; she believes that reaching one's fitness goals requires a holistic approach in which what goes into the body is as important as what comes out.
                <br><br>
                Coming from an engineering background, Tammy looks at things from an analytical point of view. Recently Tammy completed two seminars on cycling with power meters. Tammy believes in continuing education and has set her sights on receiving her USAT Level II certification and USAT youth coaching certification.
